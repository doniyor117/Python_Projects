      Welcome to a captivating terminal-based challenge!
    Your mission is to uncover a secret number, generated randomly
    between 1 and 100, within just 6 attempts. Enter a valid
    number to test your guess, but beware—invalid inputs
    will trigger an error message and won’t count toward 
    your attempts. A little fun? Why not :)
